# courseStandfordML

This repository contains the code that I have done so far to complete the exercises from [Andrew's NG Machine Learning course offered by Stanford through Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).



## ‚úÖ Check the julia code where available

Because *I actually wanted to learn* and not simply get the certification from the course, starting from the course's module *05 - neural network learning*, I began to code in julia as a previous step to work with octave. You can check the justification below.

If you're not familiar with [julia,](https://julialang.org) I strongly encourage you to give it a try. It's amazing! For ML stuff, I find it much better than python.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® octave code is a mess üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è

The course imposes the use of octave / Matlab. Moreover, there are severe restrictions on each exercise concerning:

- naming of functions
- naming of variables
- project structure in general

Additionally, the nature of Matlab and Octave themselves contribute to this disaster. (e.g., each function must be in a separate file)

**Hence, I recognize that the \*Octave code is a mess!\*. Although most of it works - because I have to submit the exercises - it's far from being a piece of art. I'm almost embarrassed about it.**
